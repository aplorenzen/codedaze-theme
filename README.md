# codedaze-theme

## Thanks 
First off, thanks to [chrissainty](https://github.com/chrissainty), for sharing his brilliant [ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog [theme](https://github.com/chrissainty/codedaze-theme). He is using it over at his own blog [codedaze.io](https://codedaze.io/).

I intend to adjust this theme for my own purposes, and will be sharing the source here.

## TODO

* Update this README.md to include instructions on how to use it
* **DONE** Make a separate [branch](https://github.com/aplorenzen/codedaze-theme/tree/neoprime) for my own blog
* Update the theme to suit my own blog
